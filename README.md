This repo consists of the following following project   

## Project 1: 
  

## Project 2: Toys Sales Performance Analysis Using Power BI   

**Purpose**:   

Toys company Marketing Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to
understand the Keys drivers of their revenue; their top priority is identifying their product sales
and stores sales at different station locations. The dataset includes almost a million of sales
records for the year 2022 and 2023, so the team wants a dashboard that summarizes key
insights. Business plans that are driven by performance insights are more successful than plans
driven by just internal staff observations. The sales view must include key data points that are
summarized and aggregated in order for the leadership team to get a clear vision of the current
performance of the company.   

**Requirements**:   

In order to continuously improve and effectively market products, the dashboard must help Toys
Company decision-makers understand how their performance and the demand at different
locations, including clear projection on whether or not the company is reaching target goal.
